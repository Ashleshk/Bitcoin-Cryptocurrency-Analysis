# Exploring-the-Bitcoin-Cryptocurrency-Market

## Objective: 
To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 
In this Project I will explore the market capitalization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

## Tools and Technologies
- Technology : Python
- Libraries : pandas, matplotlib 

## Result 
- As a result of our research, I found that Bitcoin's market dominance has decreased over time due to the emergence of new altcoins, but it still remains the most widely adopted cryptocurrency.
- Additionally, we identified a correlation between regulatory changes and short-term price volatility, indicating the need for a clearer regulatory framework to stabilize the market.
